# Beluga Tutorial

This is a tutorial for using Python for parallel computing on BÃ©luga.

The computation used as an example is finding prime numbers because it is very simple.

Here are the steps required to run this tutorial:

1. Clone the github repository somewhere on Beluga, preferably in the projects space. You can use this command:

git clone https://github.com/gregorpatof/belugatutorial


2. Look at the code in prime_testing.py. This is the equivalent of your executable or script that will be run in parallel. In this case, it is only a very naive way of finding the biggest prime number bigger or equal to the number passed as a comman-line argument.

3. Look at the parallel_run.py file. This is where the multiprocessing happens. The execute function is called in parallel with a Pool object, which will run it for every argument passed but with a maximum number of concurrent instances (in this example 40 because it is the number of CPUs in on compute node on Beluga).

4. Look at the beluga_job_whole_node.sh file. This is the job file that you need to submit to run on Beluga. It uses Slurm. The lines starting with #SBATCH are the parameters for the job. You should not need to change the first 5 ones. The --time one is in hours:minutes:seconds. When you run a short job you should always put 3:00:00 because it will not affect your priority and will also not overbill us (only the resources actually used are billed). You can also give the job a name with --name=something.

5. Change the path to the parallel_run.py file in the job file so that it matches the location of your file.

6. Now you can submit the job with:

sbatch beluga_job_whole_node.sh

7. You can see if your job is running with:

sq
